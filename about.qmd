My goal for this project is to use data to help tell the story of both the Torrent and the PWHL this season. I am a huge admirer of [Alison Lukan](https://bsky.app/profile/alisonl.bsky.social) and her data driven story telling approach. I won't pretend to be in the same universe as Alison, but I am certainly inspired by her work.

I have been very lucky to have found [Isabelle Lefebvre on Github](https://github.com/IsabelleLefebvre97), who has provide very helpful documentation for the hockerytech API being used by the league, her PWHL Data Reference repo has been an incredible resource for this project.
